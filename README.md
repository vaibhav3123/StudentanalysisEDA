# 📊 Student Performance Analysis

## 🚀 Overview  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover key factors affecting **student performance**. By analyzing **gender distribution, parental education, test preparation, subject-wise performance**, and other factors, the goal is to derive actionable insights that can help improve academic success.

The analysis was conducted using **Python**, leveraging libraries such as **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**. The project also emphasizes **data cleaning**, **transformation**, and **visual storytelling**.


## 🔍 Key Findings  
- 📌 **Gender Trends**: More **female students** than male students in the dataset.
- 📌 **Parental Education Impact**:  
  - Students whose **parents have a master’s degree** tend to score higher.  
  - Students whose **parents only completed high school** tend to score lower.
- 📌 **Subject-Wise Performance**: **Math scores** tend to be the lowest compared to **reading** and **writing**.
- 📌 **Test Preparation**: Students who **completed test preparation** secured **higher scores**.
- 📌 **Number of Siblings**: The number of siblings doesn’t significantly impact student scores.
- 📌 **Lunch Type Impact**: Students with a **standard lunch** tend to perform **better** than those with a **free/reduced lunch**.
